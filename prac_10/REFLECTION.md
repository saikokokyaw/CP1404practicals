## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Around 45 minutes is my usual estimate accuracy.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

There is no huge change but i was trying my best. Sometime I can finish in time but not sometime.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

From doing these estimates, I learned the importance of making reasonable assumptions and breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
It helped me improve my critical thinking and logical reasoning skills. 
I also realized that even rough estimates can give useful insights when exact data isn't available. 
This kind of thinking can be very helpful in real-life decision-making and planning

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I was struggling with my coding, but they review that I'm doing well.

I'm getting close to be able to finish practicals in time.
